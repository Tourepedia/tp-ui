## Hierarchy and Semantics/Colors

Button component has two main type of props that changes the visual representation: Hierarchy(Order) and Semantics (Colors). We can use a combination of these two type of attributes of our purpose.

### Hierarchy

We have three levels for hierarchy: `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary`. Hierarchy decides which button should be more prominent. You can pass one of these as booleans.

```jsx live=true
<Button primary type="button">
  Click Me!
</Button>
```

### Semantics/Colors

Semantics add the state/meaning of the type of the action a button represents. We have following semantics/colors
modifiers that can be used to change the apperance:
`branded`, `success`, `danger`, `warning` and `accent`. Any of these can be passed as a boolean props to apply styles
for it.


```jsx live=true
<Button branded>Click Me!</Button>
```


> All type="submit" buttons are default to `primary and branded` states which can be overwritten.


## Playground

Play will all the props here.

```jsx live=true
<Button warning primary>
  Here
</Button>
```
