## Playground

```jsx live=true
<Alert type="assertive" status="success">
  Account details updated successfully.
</Alert>
```

## Props

Along with all props that a `div` element can accept, following special props are available.

### Status

Alert component can be rendered with `status` prop to determine the themes for alert. Following status are available:
`info`, `success`, `warning` and `error`. The default status is `info`.


```jsx live=true
<Alert status="success">
  Project successfully created.
</Alert>
```

### Type

A type for alert defines how the alert lives in `aria-live` region. Passing an `assertive` type makes the alert readout
immediately whereas a `polite` type put the alert in `aria-live="polite"` region. The type can be combined with a status
to provide any themed alert to be in a required live region. Following types are available: `assertive`, `polite`. The
default type is `polite`.

> When an assertive type is passed without passsing a `status` prop, the status will be changed to `error`.

```jsx live=true
<Alert type="assertive">
  Deletion of a project requires admin permissions.
</Alert>
```
