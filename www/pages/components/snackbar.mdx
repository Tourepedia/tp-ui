## Playground

  }})
  }}>Delete Message</Button>
```

This modules exposes several utilities (to show/hide the snackbar(s)) and a Component to manually render a Snackbar (not
recommended). We can only show one snackbar at a time as showing multiple clutters the UI and is not recommended in UX
guidelines.

The way snackbars are handled is by maintaining a queue of snackbars. If `showSnackbar` is called and there
is already a snackbar visible, this new snackbar is pushed to the queue and will be shown as soon as all the snackbars
ahead of it has been shown. A snackbar can be removed from queue (hide) without showing if required.

Each snackbar has a unique ID. A call to `showSnackbar` return the ID which can be used to programmatically hide
the snackbar. We can also lookup for the visibility state for a given ID.

## Snackbar

`Snackbar` component holds the UI implementation for a single snackbar. Along with all the props that a `div` element
can take, it accepts following props:

### timeout
Duration(in milliseconds, `default=5000`) for the visibility of the snackbar. Setting it's value to `-1` will disable auto-closing of
snackbar and will require users to manually close it. For demo purposes, most of the playgrounds will use `-1` value
for timeout.

### label [Required]

The label/message to show in the snackbar. The label should be as minimal as possible for quick reading and grasping the
intent.

```jsx live=true
<Snackbar timeout={-1}>Tourpedia is now online</Snackbar>
```

### actionText and onClick

Snackbar renders a close icon as the default close action. You can pass a custom action text and handler to be rendered
along with close icon

```jsx live=true
<Snackbar
  timeout={-1}
  actionText="Connect"
  onClick={() => alert('Your are connected!')}
  >
  Tourpedia is now online
</Snackbar>
```

### onClosed

To attach an handler when the snackbar is closed (removed from DOM).

```jsx live=true
<Snackbar
  timeout={-1}
  onClosed={() => alert('Connection closed')}
  >
  Tourpedia is now online
</Snackbar>
```


## Utilities

Utilities are simple helper functions to handle the snackbars visibility.

### `showSnackbar`

This utility can be used to show a snackbar. It has following signature:

```js
showSnackbar(
  message: string,
  actionLabel?: string, // when we want to render a custom action along with the close icon
  config?: {
    id?: string // to identify this message uniquely
    timeout?: number // snackbar's timeout prop
    onClick?: () => any // handler for custom action, only called when an `actionLabel` is provided
    onClosed?: () => any // handler for closed event
  }
): string // id the created snackbar. Will return a custom id if not id is provided in the configuration parameter
```

```jsx live=true
<Button onClick={() => showSnackbar("Hi. I'm a Shape")}>Say Hi</Button>
```


### `showSnackbarIfNot`

To avoid duplication of messages (in queue), we can use this utility. This is specially useful when we have a fix id for
a message that must not be duplicated e.g. Offline Status messages. Try clicking both of these buttons 2-3 times. The
first one will show the number of times you clicked where as the second will only be shown once. Once both are shown,
click on the next button will again show the message (queue is empty). We can use `timeout={-1}` to show a message
indefinitely and hide it programmatically/on user's actions.

Other then first argument being an ID, it has the same signature as the `showSnackbar` function has.

```jsx live=true
<>
  <Button onClick={() => showSnackbar("Project created")}>
   Push me to the queue
  </Button>
  <Button onClick={() => showSnackbarIfNot("offlineMessage", "Offline! Please check your internet connection.")}>
   I'll be visible only once
  </Button>
</>
```


### `hideSnackbar`

To hide a snackbar (id) programmatically.

```jsx live=true
function App() {
  let id
  return <>
    <Button onClick={() => {
      id = showSnackbarIfNot(
        "offlineMessage",
        "Offline! Please check your internet connection.",
        undefined,
        {
          timeout: -1
        }
      )
    }}>
      Show
    </Button>
    <Button onClick={() => {hideSnackbar(id)}}>Hide</Button>
  </>
}
```


### `isOpenSnackbar`

To check if a snackbar (id) is currently opened or not.

```jsx live=true
function App() {
  let id
  return <>
    <Button onClick={() => {
      id = showSnackbarIfNot(
        "offlineMessage",
        "Offline! Please check your internet connection."
      )
    }}>
      Show
    </Button>
    <Button onClick={() => {
      alert(isOpenSnackbar(id).toString())
    }}>Check If Open</Button>
  </>
}
```
