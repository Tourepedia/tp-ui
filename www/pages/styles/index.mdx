## Introduction

Our goal is to create a system that enables us to build consistent user experiences with ease, yet with enough flexibility to support the broad spectrum of GitHub websites. This goal is embedded in our design and code decisions. Our approach to CSS is influenced by utility-first css.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @gladio/css
```

## Usage

Import the css in your `js`

```js
import "@gladio/css"
```

or in `sass`

```sass
@import "@gladio/css"
```
